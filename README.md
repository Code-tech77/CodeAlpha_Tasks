## 🛡️ Cybersecurity : Domain CodeAlpha Internship Programme Tasks 

### 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains two core cybersecurity tasks designed to address both technical and human focused security risks:
	•	Task 1: Python based Network Sniffer (Technical Controls)
	•	Task 2: Phishing Awareness Training (Human & Organizational Controls)

Together, these projects demonstrate a well-rounded cybersecurity skillset, combining hands on technical analysis with security awareness and risk prevention.

## 🔹 TASK 1: Python Network Sniffer

#### 📘 Description

The Python Network Sniffer captures and analyzes live network traffic to help understand how data flows through a network and how different protocols operate.

This task focuses on technical network security, packet inspection, and protocol analysis using Python.

------

## 🎯 Objectives
	•	Capture live network packets
	•	Analyze packet structure and headers
	•	Identify source and destination IP addresses
	•	Detect TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic
	•	Inspect packet payloads
	•	Gain practical experience with network monitoring
-----

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Python 3
	•	Scapy
	•	Linux / macOS / Windows 
	•	Root/Admin privileges
-----
### ▶️ Example Output
```
==============================
Source IP        : 192.168.128.12
Destination IP  : 104.18.39.21
Protocol        : TCP
Source Port     : 58570
Destination Port: 443
Payload         : b'\x17\x03\x03...'
```
-----
## What This Demonstrates
	•	Real-world encrypted HTTPS traffic
	•	DNS communication over UDP
	•	Bidirectional client–server traffic
	•	Understanding of the TCP/IP model
